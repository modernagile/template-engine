# template-engine

This application seems to be generated or based on [Processing](https://processing.org/). We're not sure how to regenerate it, or how it was originally created.

## Go with the flow.

Add your translations to modern_agile_wheel_3L.json

To run on mac, open the templatr in templatr/build/application.macosx.

Check the boxes for the file types you want to generate.

Select the json file you edited with your translation.

Wait. The media kit and images will be generated.

Look for the output files in the **export** directories.

## Then what?
You will want to copy the generated media files to the ModernAgile site and continue there as explained in that README.md file.
