# template-engine

This application seems to be generated or based on [Processing](https://processing.org/). We're not sure how to regenerate it, or how it was originally created.

## Go with the flow.

Add your translations to modern_agile_wheel_3L.json

To run on mac, open the templatr in templatr/build/application.macosx (or whatever is appropriate for you).

Check the boxes for the file types you want to generate.

Select the json file you edited with your translation.

Wait. The media kit and images will be generated.

### Package
You will need to run packageMediaKit (via node, which expects shelljs package to be installed).

This js program will create package/*zip files for you. You can then take the .zip files and apply them to the ModernAgile site.

## Then what?
You will want to copy the generated media files to the ModernAgile site and continue there as explained in that README.md file.
